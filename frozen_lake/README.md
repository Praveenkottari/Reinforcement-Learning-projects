## Q-Learning Agent ðŸ§ 

This project implements a simple Q-Learning algorithm using OpenAI Gym. The agent learns an optimal policy through exploration and reward-based updates to the Q-table. It supports dynamic exploration rate decay and prints average rewards over time to track learning progress.
